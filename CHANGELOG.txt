NEEDS VIA 6.2!

-Recordings can be deleted individually
-Activities can be duplicated, documents and associated users follow - with or without whiteboards and surveys.
-Activities can be backupes and restored, documents follow and associated users if desired - 
with or without whiteboards and surveys.
-New settings were added to select if the whitebords and surveys will be added during the duplication or 
backup & restore process. The parameter applies to all activities.
-Duplicated activities will be created one month in the future to the present, leaving enough time to go 
modify the actual date and time. Unless it is a permanent activity, in which case there is no start time or duration.
-If a grouping is selected for an activity, only the users associated with the grouping will be synchronised. 
If manual enrollemnt is chosen, other users may be added to the activity but will not be synchronised.

state. And added the confirmation status to this table, we removed the confirmation table from underneath the participants table.

be deleted in Moodle but not in Via.

take up to 10 minutes before the changes are made to the via participants table.
-For this to work a new column was added to the via participants table and new 
functions were added to via_cron.

categories will be available and can even add one as default. 
-Then when an activity is created the teacher can chose from the available categories.
